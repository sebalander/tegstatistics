# tegstatistics
I'm probably not the first one to wonder wether some people are prone
to get better dice rolls than others. TEG is a game highly dependent
on dice rolling performance. I recently played TEG with other three
people and took the time to record each player's scores.

I intend to analyse with elementary statistic tools the performance of
each player. I want to find quantitatively if some people really are
better dice throwers. 

This is just for fun, I don't mean to go too deep in the formalism.
